# KaiOS-sample

This is a ready to use sample webApp for KaiOS.

It is based on my own apps and uses very simple JavaScript, to help everyone understand what is going on.
Please feel free to use it as a starting point for your own KaiOS app!

It is not meant to be a reference app, just an example extracted from my work.

The sample covers navigation, switching views, input fields, local storage and KaiAds integration.

## Prerequisites
If you want to publish your new app to the official KaiStore, it is highly recommended including KaiAds.
Please refer to the KaiAds website for the latest SDK:
https://www.kaiads.com/publishers/sdk.html

Simply download the SDK and move the js-file into the code directory.

You will find lots of useful resources here, regarding specific KaiOS requirements and general Firefox OS development (which KaiOS is based on):
